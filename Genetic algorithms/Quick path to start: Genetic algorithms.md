## Quick path to start: Genetic algorithms

### Step 1: gain insight into the subject

Watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQj5UNhCPuo&ab_channel=KieCodes

### Step 2: build a broader vision

Skim through this general reading : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm

Focus on the general concepts, usually present in the first paragraph.

### Step 3: approach to code

Start with a python package! The processes and the writing of the code will be more understandable and clear.

Read PyGAD package documentation: https://pygad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_pygad_ReadTheDocs.html#pygad-ga-class
No need to know all functionalities and read all, just the minimum necessary for following the examples provided.

Be sure to understand this example on a linear model optimization, and try to replicate it with different data: https://pygad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README_pygad_ReadTheDocs.html#linear-model-optimization

### Step 4: test yourself

Try to solve a basic optimization problem with what you have learned, here is the problem.
A van in a shop must be filled to transport household appliances, its load must be optimized by maximizing the value of what is transported for a given volume. You have a file with occupied space, price and quantity of certain products (file at https://github.com/Ishikawa7/Quick-paths-to-start/tree/main/Genetic%20algorithms/Step%204). Test for variable free space values, for example between 1 and 5.
